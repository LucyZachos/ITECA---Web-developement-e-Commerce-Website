### Project Description
I developed an e-commerce website for the fictional company, incorporating essential features such as:

- **Index Page**: A landing page providing an overview of the company and its products.
- **Shop**: A section where users can browse and purchase self-defense keyrings, scrunchies, and budget binders.
- **Account Page**: An area where customers manage their profiles.
- **Create account and login page**: Users could only make purchases if they had an account.
- **Cart and Checkout**: Functionality allows users to add products to their cart, review their selections, make changes by removing or editing the quantity of products, and complete the purchase process.

Additionally, the website includes administrative capabilities, allowing the owner to:

- Sign in and manage products independently.
- Edit, delete, or add products as needed.

### Database
The Eduvos E-Commerce website is powered by a MySQL database, which stores essential information such as product details, and customer accounts.
